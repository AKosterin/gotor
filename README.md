GoTor is my attempt at implementing a full Tor relay in the Go language. I ended up dropping the project, but a full writeup can be found [on my blog](http://www.tvdw.eu/blog/2015/01/24/implementing-a-tor-relay-from-scratch/).

The code is licensed under the BSD 3-clause license, see the file called 'LICENSE'.

**Please do not use this code on a production relay. It is insecure, unstable, and potentially harmful to the network.**
